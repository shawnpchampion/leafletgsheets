I explained the process in more length in my blog post here: [Leaflet maps with data from Google Sheets](https://rdrn.me/leaflet-maps-google-sheets/).

In each one, do the following three steps:
   - In Google Sheets, go to File -> Publish to the Web -> Publish
   - Choose "Comma-separated values (.csv)" in the dropdown on the right
   - Then copy the link provided just underneath, and save it somewhere

At line 7 in main.js where it says "PASTE YOUR URLs HERE", paste the URLs you copied above
